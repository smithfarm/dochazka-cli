}


=head2 do_parse_test

A piece of testing code we run for entries in CommandMap.pm 

Takes the "normalized command", i.e. the C<nc> property returned by C<parse()>;
especially do not send it the raw command entered by the user!

For usage, see C<< t/parser/parse_test.t >>

=cut

sub do_parse_test {
    my ( $nc, $handler ) = @_;
    my $coderef = look_up_command( $nc );
    is( ref( $coderef ), 'CODE', "look_up_command( $nc ) returns a code reference" );
    my $status = $coderef->( 'PARSE_TEST' => 1 );
    ok( $status->ok );
    is( $status->payload, $handler, "handler of $nc is $handler" );
}


=head2 fetch_interval_test

Takes a "command component" and a search string to look for. The command
component is inserted into 

    INTERVAL FETCH $cmd_component

and the search string is looked for in the response.

Returns the response (payload) string for (optional) further testing.

=cut

sub fetch_interval_test {
    my ( $cmd_component, $search_str ) = @_;

    note( my $cmd = "INTERVAL FETCH $cmd_component" );
    my $rv = process_command( $cmd );
    is( ref( $rv ), 'App::CELL::Status' );
    is( $rv->level, 'OK' );
    is( $rv->code, 'DOCHAZKA_CLI_NORMAL_COMPLETION' );
    like( $rv->payload, qr/Attendance intervals of worker.+$search_str/ms );

    return $rv->payload;
