=head1 NAME

App::Dochazka::CLI::Parser - Parser module



=head1 PACKAGE VARIABLES AND EXPORTS

=over

=item C<< generate_semantic_tree >>

Populate the C<< $semantic_tree >> package variable.

=item C<< lookup_command >>

=item C<< parse >>

Parse the command string entered by the user.

=item C<< possible_words >>

Given a state expressed as a stack of tokens, return list of possible tokens.

=item C<< process_command >>

Given a command string, process it (by parsing, calling the handler, etc.) and
return the result.

=item C<< $semantic_tree >>

The semantic tree is a traversable tree representation of the CLI commands,
i.e. the keys of the dispatch map C<< $App::Dochazka::CLI::CommandMap::dispatch_map >>

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 generate_semantic_tree

Generate the semantic context tree.

The set of keys of C<< %$dispatch_map >> contains all the possible commands,
each expressed as a sequence of tokens. The semantic context tree is generated
from the dispatch map keys. Each node of the tree represents a possible token
and the set of nodes at depth n of the tree is the set of possible tokens in
the nth position within the command. 

Taking, for example, a dispatch map consisting of the following two commands:

    ABE BABEL CAROL
    DALE EARL JENSEN PARLOR
    DALE TWIT

The semantic tree would be:

    (root)
    |
    +-----------+
    |           |
    ABE        DALE
    |           |
    |           +------+
    |           |      |
    BABEL      EARL   TWIT
    |           |
    CAROL      JENSEN
                |
               PARLOR

The point of this exercise is to facilitate command completion. If two a single
token ABE has been entered by the user and <TAB> is pressed, finding out that
BABEL is the only possible command in this position is a simple matter of
traversing the above semantic tree. (And this is exactly what is done by the
C<possible_words> routine in L<App::Dochazka::CLI::Parser>.)

This routine takes an optional argument which, if provided, is assumed to be a
reference to a dispatch map. In the absence of this argument, the
C<$dispatch_map> package variable (initialized above) is used.

For this and more examples, see C<t/parser/semantic_tree.t>.

    # ( if $dm is given -- e.g., for testing --, then use it. Otherwise, use
    # the $dispatch_map package variable )

=head2 look_up_command

Given a normalized command string such as "GET BUGREPORT", look it up in the
dispatch map and return the corresponding coderef, or nothing if the lookup
fails.

=cut

sub look_up_command {
    my ( $cmd ) = @_;

    # check for undef and empty string
    return unless defined( $cmd ) and $cmd =~ m/\S/;

    # check for a match
    if ( my $coderef = $App::Dochazka::CLI::CommandMap::dispatch_map->{ uc( $cmd ) } ) {
        return $coderef;
    }

    # failure - return nothing
    return;
}


=head2 parse

Parse command string entered by the user. Takes the command string, and returns:

=over

=item C<< $nc >>

The normalized command - suitable for lookup via C<look_up_command>

=item C<< $ts >>

The token stack - a reference to the list of normalized tokens

=item C<< $th >>

The token hash - a hash where the keys are the normalized tokens and the values
are the raw values extracted from the command string. Whatever is left after
command string parsing completes will be placed in the '_REMAINDER' key.
